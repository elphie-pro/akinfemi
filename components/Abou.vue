                <h2> Onadeko Akinfemi is a self-taught and highly motivated <br> software engineer with solid experience in frontend <br> development of systems that scale to a lot of users.</h2>
                <h2>My coding journey began in the 8th grade in high school <br> when many of my schoolmates were making websites for <br> fun, which caught my attention. Unlike others, I didn't <br> eventually drop web development; instead, it continuously <br> piqued my interest and made me want to dive deeper into <br> the world of tech. My career as a developer started <br> officially in the 9th grade when I could confidently build <br> different websites by myself and i eventually started <br> working with JavaScript.</h2>
                <h2>Today, with expertise in Frontend development and UI/ <br>UX design, combined with resilience and determination, <br> along with skills in various technologies like React.js, <br> Vue.js, Figma, and more, I've had the opportunity to <br> collaborate with great minds to engineer solutions to <br> problems.</h2>
                <h2>I'm always excited to take on challenging problems head- <br> on, using the tools in my arsenal to positively impact  the <br> world with ones and zeros.</h2>
