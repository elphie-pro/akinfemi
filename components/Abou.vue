                <h2>My coding journey began in the 8th grade in high school <br> when many of my schoolmates were making websites for <br> fun, which caught my attention. Unlike others, I didn't <br> eventually drop web development; instead, it continuously <br> piqued my interest and made me want to dive deeper into <br> the world of tech. My career as a developer started <br> officially in the 9th grade when I could confidently build <br> different websites by myself and i eventually started <br> working with JavaScript.</h2>
